# Todo Application

This Todo application is built as a full-stack web application. It leverages Angular for the front end and Express.js for the local back end. MongoDB is used as the database to store task-related information. The application offers a straightforward interface for managing your to-do list, with essential features:

- **Create**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Read**: View your existing tasks.
- **Update**: Edit and update task content.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from your list.

It's worth noting that this application doesn't rely on external APIs but uses Express.js as a local server to serve the Angular front end and handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular.js, javascript, ejs
- **Backend**: Express.js (Local server)
- **Database**: MongoDB
